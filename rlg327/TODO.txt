General to-do notes, more specific TODOS are in each file.

Remove wunit->contents, bitwise operators make code confusing and are not efficient
Replace with an int that keeps track of the contents, and is simply populated with the ASCII
character that the unit should be represented by.

Update Monster and player files to make use of bools in each struct to keep track of attributes instead.
May re-use the representation as 4bits to save the monsters to a file later.

Add controls as per the project description for 1.05.

Add stairs last. Should generate a new floor after moving down/up stairs
