Code as of now places the PC in the center of first generated room.
Code starts by default in look mode, so pressing escape allows you to move the PC.
Will eventually add an indicator to the first row of terminal stating which mode is active.
Code is working, has occassional issue with drawing the dungeon border. Need to shrink ncurses window.
Have not yet implemented stairs.

Code will auto-exit if player and monster come in contact. No message is printed for now, as we will be changing
the interaction between monsters and PC in later project.

All controls conform to project description, no additional controls added.

Usage is: dungeon [options]
--save save dungeon to file at ./rlg327
--load load dungeon from file at ./rlg327
--help display this help message
--nummon allows for specification of number of monsters
