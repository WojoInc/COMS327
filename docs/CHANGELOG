    Fully implemented and tested dijkstra and heap. Incorporated these into the main program by adding a --display option, which will generate, but not save, a dungeon, and then display the path graph overlayed on the dungeon as well. Added Makefile, CHANGELOG, and README to project as well. Files are ready to be merged into master.

    Dijkstra's fully implemented, reimplemented heap to use an array instead. Program has a segfault problem, seems like an array issue. Easy to sort out. Program does compile so committing progress for now. Also added proj_incl to project to keep track of commonly used headers.

    Began project from scratch again, implemented priority queue using simple min heap. Need to iron out issues with multiple successive removals from the heap. Could make heap faster in the future by adding alpha balancing, but not needed for now.

    Removed and restarted dijkstra code, using a much more efficient and easy to understand method, will not worry about using the priority queue for now, but may add it at a later date.

    Commit for Assignment 1.03 files, created a simple queue, began laying out basic setup for dijkstra. Also modified some aspects of the struct for w_unit

commit 368e90b8eeaf08aa3b6b96be769ad425bf71c014
Author: Thomas John Wesolowski <wojoinc@iastate.edu>
Date:   Wed Feb 1 22:35:48 2017 -0600

    Fixed issue where load method would not draw corridors. Also fixed issue whereby cell hardness was implemented, but random cell hardness was not part of generateDungeon(). Also improved random generation of room position and size, as 0s could be generated which would cause checkRoom() to go out of the array bounds when checking the area around a room, causing random intermittent segfaults. Also cleaned up unnecessary code , and added additional comments, and descriptions to function prototypes in header files.

    Added command line arguments, cleaned up code. Still have issue with load method.

    Fixed issue with endianess, as I had not realized the functions used were byte-order, and not bit order. Also, reworked the dungeon struct to include a pointer representation, avoiding the "invalid use of flexible member" error, allowing it to be dynamically allocated when loading a dungeon, rather than needing the number of rooms to be defined at compile time.  Also fixed d_HEIGHT and d_WIDTH in dungeon.h as I had the values backwards from the last assignment, which caused dungeons to be written in the wrong order. Added seperate functions for opening file and parsing file path in order to clean up code and correctly report errors. Need to implement command line args still.

    Implemeted saving of dungeon as well as loading. Loading still has some issues to wrok out, namely correctly caluclating the number of rooms to draw. Also need to check to make sure values are being converted to and from big endian when needed.

Date:   Wed Jan 25 20:08:48 2017 -0600

    Updated corridor drawing algorithm to use the centroid of each room and connect to the closest room, rather than in order of generation. Added javadoc-esque comment blocks to all function declarations in main.h

    Finished project. Only things left to do are optimization of the corridor drawing to draw from the center of a room, and to connect the closest room, in order to clean up number of needless corridors drawn.

    Implemented room generation. Fixed issue with dungeon not correctly outputting to console. Migrated all aspects of world units within the dungeon struct into a w_unit struct rather than an enum, as this caused issues and made code sloppy.
