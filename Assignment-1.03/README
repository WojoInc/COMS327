Code runs fine, there is however an issue with the way the load method works, it needs to be updated to properly draw the corridors between rooms.
UPDATE: Above issue fixed, --save and --load now work fine. See changelog for details.

Usage is: dungeon [options]
--save save dungeon to file at ./rlg327
--load load dungeon from file at ./rlg327
--help display this help message
